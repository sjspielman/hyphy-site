            "text": "Overview\n#\n\n\nHyPhy (\nHy\npothesis Testing using \nPhy\nlogenies) is an open-source software package for the analysis of genetic sequences (in particular the inference of natural selection) using techniques in phylogenetics, molecular evolution, and machine learning. It features a rich scripting language for limitless customization of analyses. Additionally, HyPhy features support for parallel computing environments (via message passing interface). HyPhy has over 10000 registered users and has been cited in over 1800 peer-reviewed publications (\nGoogle Scholar\n). \n\n\nBrief history\n#\n\n\nHyPhy grew out of the collaboration between \nSpencer Muse\n and \nSergei Kosakovsky Pond\n that commenced in 1997 and continues to this day, with many additional collaborators, including \nArt Poon\n, \nSimon Frost\n, \nSteven Weaver\n, \nStephanie Spielman\n, \nLance Hepler\n, \nMartin Smith\n, \nKonrad Scheffler\n, \nWayne Delport\n, \nBen Murrell\n, and \nJoel Wertheim\n. HyPhy was originally released in 2000, is currently at version 2.3, and is presently undergoing a major rewrite, with version v3.0 planned for release in 2018. \n\n\nDesign philosophy\n#\n\n\nHyPhy was designed to allow the specification and fitting of a broad class of continuous-time discrete-space Markov models of sequence evolution. To implement these models, HyPhy provides its own scripting language - \nHBL\n, or \nHyPhy Batch Language\n (see \nan example\n), which can be used to develop custom analyses or modify existing ones. Importantly, it is not necessary to learn (or even be aware of) HBL in order to use HyPhy, as most common models and analyses have been implemented for user convenience. Once a model is defined, it can be fitted to data (using a fixed topology tree), its parameters can be constrained in user-defined ways to test various hypotheses (e.g. is rate1 \n rate2), and simulate data from. HyPhy primarily implements \nmaximum likelihood\n methods, but it can also be used to perform some forms of Bayesian inference (e.g. \nFUBAR\n), fit Bayesian graphical models to data, run genetic algorithms to perform complex model selection.\n\n\nFeatures\n#\n\n\n\n\nSupport for arbitrary sequence data, including nucleotide, amino-acid, codon, binary, count (microsattelite) data, including multiple partitions mixing differen data types. \n\n\nComplex models of rate variation, including site-to-site, branch-to-branch, hidden markov model (autocorrelated rates), between/within partitions, and co-varion type models.\n\n\nFast numerical fitting routines, supporting parallel and distributed execution.\n\n\nA broad collection of pre-defined evolutionary models. \n\n\nThe ability to specify flexible constraints on model parameters and estimate confidence intervals on MLEs.\n\n\nAncestral sequence reconstruction and sampling. \n\n\nSimulate data from any model that can be defined and fitted in the language.\n\n\nApply unique (for this domain) machine learning methods to discover patterns in the data, e.g. genetic algorithms, stochastic context free grammars, Bayesian graphical models.\n\n\nScript analyses completely in HBL including flow control, I/O, parallelization, etc.\n\n\n(v2.3) Modern web-applications for interactive result visualization.\n\n\n\n\nExample HBL Script\n#\n\n\n/* \n\n\n   This is an example HYPHY Batch File.\n\n\n   It reads in a MEGA format nucleotide dataset from data/hiv.nuc.\n\n\n   and fits the F81 model using the tree inclded in the file using maximum likelihood.\n\n\n   Output is printed out as a Newick Style tree with branch lengths\n\n\n   representing the number of expected substitutions per branch.\n\n\n*/\n\n\n\n// 1.

Here, we provide an overview of each method. For help determining which method best suits your specific needs, follow \nthese guidelines\n.\n\n\naBSREL\n#\n\n\naBSREL (\na\ndaptive \nB\nranch-\nS\nite \nR\nandom \nE\nffects \nL\nikelihood) is an improved version of the commonly-used \"branch-site\" models, which are used to test if positive selection has occurred on a proportion of branches. As such, aBSREL models both site-level and branch-level \n\\omega\n  heterogeneity. aBSREL, however, does not test for selection at specific sites. Instead, aBSREL will test, for each branch (or branch of interest) in the phylogeny, whether a proportion of sites have evolved under positive selection. \n\n\naBSREL differs from other branch-site model implementations by inferring the optimal number of \n\\omega\n  classes for each branch. For example, the earlier HyPhy branch-site approach (BS-REL) assumed three \n\\omega\n  rate classes for each branch and assigned each site, with some probability, to one of these classes. aBSREL, by contrast, acknowledges that different branches may feature more or less complex evolutionary patterns and hence may be better modeled by more or fewer \n\\omega\n classes. Specifically, aBSREL uses AIC\nc\n (small sample AIC) to infer the optimal number of \n\\omega\n rate classes for each branch. \n\n\nAfter aBSREL fits the full adaptive model, the Likelihood Ratio Test is performed at each branch and compares the full model to a null model where branches are not allowed to have rate classes of \n\\omega>1\n. \n\n\naBSREL can be run in two modes:\n\n\n\n\nTest a specific hypothesis by \na priori\n selecting a set of \"foreground\" branches to test for positive selection. \n\n\nPerform an exploratory analysis where all branches are tested for positive selection. In this scenario, p-values at each branch must be corrected for multiple testing (using the Holm-Bonferroni correction). Due to multiple testing, the exploratory approach \nhas much lower power\n compared to the other approach. \n\n\n\n\nIf you use aBSREL in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nSmith, MD et al. \"Less is more: an adaptive branch-site random effects model for efficient detection of episodic diversifying selection.\" Mol. Biol. Evol. 32, 1342\u20131353 (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nBUSTED\n#\n\n\nBUSTED (\nB\nranch-\nS\nite \nU\nnrestricted \nS\ntatistical \nT\nest for \nE\npisodic \nD\niversification) provides a gene-wide (\nnot site-specific\n) test for positive selection by asking whether a gene has experienced positive selection at at least one site on at least one branch. When running BUSTED, users can either specify a set of foreground branches on which to test for positive selection (remaining branches are designated \"background\"), or users can test the entire phylogeny for positive selection. In the latter case, the entire tree is effectively treated as foreground, and the test for positive selection considers the entire phylogeny.\n\n\nFor each phylogenetic partition (foreground and background branch sites), BUSTED fits a codon model with three rate classes, constrained as \n\\omega_1 \\leq \\omega_2 \\leq 1 \\leq \\omega_3\n. As in other methods, BUSTED simultaneously estimates the proportion of sites per partition belonging to each \n\\omega\n  class. This model, used as the alternative model in selection testing, is referred to as the \nUnconstrained\n model. BUSTED then tests for positive selection by comparing this model fit to a null model where \n\\omega_3 = 1\n (i.e. disallowing positive selection) on the foreground branches. This null model is also referred to as the \nConstrained\n model. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then there is evidence that at least one site has, at least some of the time, experienced positive selection on the foreground branches. Importantly, a significant result \ndoes not\n mean that the gene evolved under positive selection along the entire foreground.\n\n\nBUSTED additionally calculates \"Evidence Ratios\" (ERs) for each site. The ER gives the likelihood ratio (reported on a log-scale) that the alternative model was a better fit to the data compared to the null model. The ER for each site thus provides \ndescriptive information\n about whether a given site could have evolved under positive selection. The ERs \nshould not\n be interpreted as statistical evidence for positive selection at individual sites (instead, methods like \nMEME\n, \nFEL\n, or \nFUBAR\n should be used for detecting selection at individual sites). \n\n\nFor each site, two ERs are reported: the \nConstrained Model\n ER and the \nOptimized Null\n Model ER. The Constrained Model ER calculates the evidence ratio using model parameters inferred from the Constrained model. By contrast, the Optimized Null model ER re-optimizes parameters inferred using the Constrained model for the given site of interest. These optimized parameter values are then used to calculate the site's ER. Again, while these ERs may be helpful descriptors of selection in the data set, they do not provide statistically valid evidence for positive selection at a site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\n\nIf you use BUSTED in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"Gene-wide identification of episodic selection.\" Mol.

This method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny. \n\n\nAfter optimizing branch lengths and nucleotide substitution parameters, FEL fits a MG94xREV model to each codon site to infer site-specific nonsynonymous and synonymous (dN and dS, respectively) substitution rates. Hypothesis testing is then conducted on a site-specific basis, using the Likelihood Ratio Test, to ascertain if dN is significantly greater than dS.\n\n\nIf you use FEL in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nKosakovsky Pond, SL and Frost, SDW. \"Not So Different After All: A Comparison of Methods for Detecting Amino Acid Sites Under Selection.\" Mol.

This method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.\n\n\nAlthough FUBAR produces similar information to FEL, it has several key differences:\n\n\n\n\nFUBAR employs a Bayesian algorithm to infer rates, and therefore it reports evidence for positive selection using \nposterior probabilities\n (which range from 0-1), not p-values. Generally, posterior probabilities \n 0.9 are strongly suggestive of positive selection. \n\n\nFUBAR runs extremely quickly and is well-suited for analyzing large alignments, with hundreds or thousands of sequences. This speed-up results from the novel strategy of employing a pre-specified discrete grid of dN and dS values to be applied across sites. This approach contrasts with the time-consuming FEL strategy of fitting a new MG94xREV model at each site.\n\n\nFUBAR may have more power than FEL, in particular when positive selection is present but relatively weak (i.e. low values of \n\\omega>1\n).\n\n\n\n\nIf you use FUBAR in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for inferring selection.\" Mol.

Because recombinant sequences cannot be adequately described with a single phylogenetic history, selection inference on recombinant data often leads to a significant increase in false positives. GARD alleviates this concern by comprehensively screening an alignment for recombination breakpoints and inferring a unique phylogenetic history for each detected recombination block.\n\n\nIf GARD detects recombination in your dataset, it will provide you with an updated \npartitioned\n dataset, where each partition corresponds to a recombination block with its own corresponding phylogeny. This partitioned dataset can then be used as input (instead of your original data) for the selection inference method of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use GARD in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nKosakovsky Pond, SL et al. \"Automated Phylogenetic Detection of Recombination Using a Genetic Algorithm.\" Mol.

Importantly, to infer \n\\omega\n rates, MEME infers a single \n\\alpha\n (dS) value and two separate \n\\beta\n (dN) values, \n\\beta^-\n and \n\\beta^+\n, which share the same \n\\alpha\n, per site. For both the null and alternative model, MEME enforces the constraint \n\\beta^- \\leq \\alpha\n. The \n\\beta^+\n parameter is therefore the key difference between null and alternative models: In the null model, \n\\beta^+\n is constrained as in the null model: \n\\beta^+ \\leq \\alpha\n, but \n\\beta^+\n is not constrained in the alternative model. Ultimately, positive selection for each site is inferred when \n\\beta^+ > \\alpha\n and shown to be significant using the likelihood ratio test. \n\n\nIf you use MEME in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nMurrell, B et al. \"Detecting individual sites subject to episodic diversifying selection.\" PLoS Genetics 8, e1002764 (2012).\n\n\n\n\n\nRELAX\n#\n\n\nRELAX is a hypothesis testing framework that asks whether the strength of natural selection has been relaxed or intensified along a specified set of test branches. RELAX is therefore \nnot\n a suitable method for explicitly testing for positive selection. Instead, RELAX is most useful for identifying trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection on a given gene.\n\n\nRELAX requires a specified set of \"test\" branches to compare with a second set of \"reference\" branches (note that all branches do not have to be assigned, but one branch is required the test and reference set each). RELAX begins by fitting a codon model with three \n\\omega\n  classes to the entire phylogeny (null model). RELAX then tests for relaxed/intensified selection by introducing the parameter \nk\n (where \nk \\geq 0\n), serving as the \nselection intensity parameter\n, as an exponent for the inferred \n\\omega\n  values: \n\\omega^k\n. Specifically, RELAX fixes the inferred \n\\omega\n values (all \n\\omega_{<1,2,3>}\n) and infers, for the test branches, a value for \nk\n which modifies the rates to \n\\omega_{<1,2,3>}^k\n (alternative model). RELAX then conducts a Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the alternative and null models. \n\n\nA significant result of \nk\n1 indicates that selection strength has been intensified\n along the test branches, and a significant result of \nk\n1 indicates that selection strength has been relaxed\n along the test branches.\n\n\nIn addition to this pair of null/alternative models, RELAX fits three other models meant as complementary descriptors for the data, but are not suitable for hypothesis testing. These additional models include the following:\n\n\n\n\nPartitioned MG94xREV\n - This model fits a single \n\\omega\n value, i.e. shared for all sites, to each branch partition (reference and test). Here, a total of two \n\\omega\n rates are inferred.\n\n\nPartitioned Descriptive\n - This model, like a more standard branch-site model, fits three \n\\omega\n  classes separately to each branch partition (reference and test, producing a total of six estimated \n\\omega\n rates estimated). The selection intensity parameter \nk\n is not included.\n\n\nGeneral Descriptive\n - This model fits three \n\\omega\n  classes to the full data set, ignoring the specified test and reference partition division (three total \n\\omega\n rates estimated). It subsequently fits a \nk\n parameter at each branch, ultimately tailoring the three \n\\omega\n  class values to this branch. This model may serve as a useful description of how selection intensity fluctuates over the whole tree.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use RELAX in your analysis, please cite the following:\n \nWertheim, JO et al. \"RELAX: detecting relaxed selection in a phylogenetic framework.\" Mol.

Like FEL, this method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny. \n\n\nSLAC begins by optimizing branch lengths and nucleotide substitution parameters under the MG94xREV model. However, rather than using ML to fit site-specific dN and dS parameters, SLAC instead uses ML to infer the most likely ancestral sequence at each node of the phylogeny. SLAC then employs a modified version of the \nSuzuki-Gojobori counting method\n to directly count the total number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes which have occurred at each site.

In this scenario, p-values at each branch must be corrected for multiple testing (using the Holm-Bonferroni correction). Due to multiple testing, the exploratory approach  has much lower power  compared to the other approach.

            "text": "BUSTED ( B ranch- S ite  U nrestricted  S tatistical  T est for  E pisodic  D iversification) provides a gene-wide ( not site-specific ) test for positive selection by asking whether a gene has experienced positive selection at at least one site on at least one branch. When running BUSTED, users can either specify a set of foreground branches on which to test for positive selection (remaining branches are designated \"background\"), or users can test the entire phylogeny for positive selection. In the latter case, the entire tree is effectively treated as foreground, and the test for positive selection considers the entire phylogeny.  For each phylogenetic partition (foreground and background branch sites), BUSTED fits a codon model with three rate classes, constrained as  \\omega_1 \\leq \\omega_2 \\leq 1 \\leq \\omega_3 . As in other methods, BUSTED simultaneously estimates the proportion of sites per partition belonging to each  \\omega   class. This model, used as the alternative model in selection testing, is referred to as the  Unconstrained  model. BUSTED then tests for positive selection by comparing this model fit to a null model where  \\omega_3 = 1  (i.e. disallowing positive selection) on the foreground branches. This null model is also referred to as the  Constrained  model. If the null hypothesis is rejected, then there is evidence that at least one site has, at least some of the time, experienced positive selection on the foreground branches. Importantly, a significant result  does not  mean that the gene evolved under positive selection along the entire foreground.  BUSTED additionally calculates \"Evidence Ratios\" (ERs) for each site. The ER gives the likelihood ratio (reported on a log-scale) that the alternative model was a better fit to the data compared to the null model. The ER for each site thus provides  descriptive information  about whether a given site could have evolved under positive selection. The ERs  should not  be interpreted as statistical evidence for positive selection at individual sites (instead, methods like  MEME ,  FEL , or  FUBAR  should be used for detecting selection at individual sites).   For each site, two ERs are reported: the  Constrained Model  ER and the  Optimized Null  Model ER. The Constrained Model ER calculates the evidence ratio using model parameters inferred from the Constrained model. By contrast, the Optimized Null model ER re-optimizes parameters inferred using the Constrained model for the given site of interest. These optimized parameter values are then used to calculate the site's ER. Again, while these ERs may be helpful descriptors of selection in the data set, they do not provide statistically valid evidence for positive selection at a site.

This method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.  Although FUBAR produces similar information to FEL, it has several key differences:   FUBAR employs a Bayesian algorithm to infer rates, and therefore it reports evidence for positive selection using  posterior probabilities  (which range from 0-1), not p-values. Generally, posterior probabilities   0.9 are strongly suggestive of positive selection.   FUBAR runs extremely quickly and is well-suited for analyzing large alignments, with hundreds or thousands of sequences. This speed-up results from the novel strategy of employing a pre-specified discrete grid of dN and dS values to be applied across sites. This approach contrasts with the time-consuming FEL strategy of fitting a new MG94xREV model at each site.

For each site, MEME infers two  \\omega  rate classes and corresponding weights representing the probability that the site evolves under  \\omega  rate class, at a given branch.

            "text": "RELAX is a hypothesis testing framework that asks whether the strength of natural selection has been relaxed or intensified along a specified set of test branches. RELAX is therefore  not  a suitable method for explicitly testing for positive selection. Instead, RELAX is most useful for identifying trends and/or shifts in the stringency of natural selection on a given gene.  RELAX requires a specified set of \"test\" branches to compare with a second set of \"reference\" branches (note that all branches do not have to be assigned, but one branch is required the test and reference set each). RELAX begins by fitting a codon model with three  \\omega   classes to the entire phylogeny (null model). RELAX then tests for relaxed/intensified selection by introducing the parameter  k  (where  k \\geq 0 ), serving as the  selection intensity parameter , as an exponent for the inferred  \\omega   values:  \\omega^k . Specifically, RELAX fixes the inferred  \\omega  values (all  \\omega_{<1,2,3>} ) and infers, for the test branches, a value for  k  which modifies the rates to  \\omega_{<1,2,3>}^k  (alternative model). RELAX then conducts a Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the alternative and null models.   A significant result of  k 1 indicates that selection strength has been intensified  along the test branches, and a significant result of  k 1 indicates that selection strength has been relaxed  along the test branches.  In addition to this pair of null/alternative models, RELAX fits three other models meant as complementary descriptors for the data, but are not suitable for hypothesis testing. These additional models include the following:   Partitioned MG94xREV  - This model fits a single  \\omega  value, i.e. shared for all sites, to each branch partition (reference and test). Here, a total of two  \\omega  rates are inferred.  Partitioned Descriptive  - This model, like a more standard branch-site model, fits three  \\omega   classes separately to each branch partition (reference and test, producing a total of six estimated  \\omega  rates estimated). The selection intensity parameter  k  is not included.  General Descriptive  - This model fits three  \\omega   classes to the full data set, ignoring the specified test and reference partition division (three total  \\omega  rates estimated). It subsequently fits a  k  parameter at each branch, ultimately tailoring the three  \\omega   class values to this branch.

Like FEL, this method assumes that the selection pressure for each site is constant along the entire phylogeny.   SLAC begins by optimizing branch lengths and nucleotide substitution parameters under the MG94xREV model.

This result means that disallowing positive selection results in a \nsignificantly worse fit\n to the data. \nWe therefore reject the null hypothesis that there is no episodic positive selection on the specified foreground branch(es).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse aBSREL to find lineages which have experienced episodic diversification.\n#\n\n\n\n\naBSREL\n is a method described in \nSmith et al\n. It is an extension of our popular \nBS-REL model\n, which performs a complexity analysis and model selection prior to doing hypothesis testing. It runs much faster than BS-REL and has better statistical properies.\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, we will run aBSREL on the dataset \nHIV.nex\n, which includes partial clonal HIV-1 env sequences from epidemiologically linked partners (source/donor and recipient). Note that this analysis differs from the BUSTED example described above because aBSREL will scan the phylogeny\nfor all the branches where selection may have operated. As with BUSTED, we will run aBSREL in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nRun aBSREL to test for selection by scanning all branches in the tree.\n\n\nRun BUSTED to test for selection by testing only an \na priori\n selection of branches. This approach of analysis will have increased power to detect lineage-specific selection.\n\n\n\n\naBSREL: Full tree analysis\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch HyPhy from the command line by entering \nHYPHYMP\n.

You may select option \n1\n, although aBSREL will run much more slowly without substantial benefit. \n\n\nEnter the \nabsolute path\n to your dataset (in this case, a NEXUS file): \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex\n.      \n\n\nEnter \nY\n to confirm that HyPhy should use the tree provided in the dataset file. \n\n\nImportantly\n, if you have modified the tree in this NEXUS file for use with BUSTED or RELAX (e.g. branch annotations), \nenter\n \nN\n and instead provide the tree file \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nwk\n (a clean newick tree file) at the next menu prompt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter \n2\n to select \nAll\n branches to test for selection with aBSREL.\n\n\nEnter \nd\n to indicate that your branch selection is complete. \n\n\nEnter an \nabsolute path\n to a file where aBSREL output should be saved, for example \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex.aBSREL\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis will now run for several (many) minutes and produce a lot of diagnostic output while running, corresponding to aBSREL analysis stages:\n\n\n\n\n[PHASE 0]\n: As the initial phase, aBSREL fits the standard \nMG94xREV\n model to estimate a single \n\\omega\n for each branch and prints out model fit statistics. This is the simplest model that can be selected by aBSREL.\n\n\n[PHASE 1]\n: aBSREL then sorts all the branches by length (longest first), and tries to greedily add \n\\omega\n categories to one branch at a time, until the addition is no longer justified by AIC\nc\n scores.\n\n\n[INFERRED MODEL COMPLEXITY]\n: When aBSREL has determined the optimal number of \n\\omega\n categories at each branch, a summary of inferred model complexity will be printed to the screen.\n\n\n[PHASE 2]\n: Next, aBSREL optimizes all model parameters for the branch models determined in \n[PHASE 1]\n.\n\n\nNext, aBSREL will test all the branches selected in step 1.8 above (in this example, \nAll\n branches) to see if there is a proportion of sites\nwith \n\\omega > 1\n along that branch. aBSREL further assesses, using branch-specific Likelihood ratio tests, whether disallowing any categories of \n\\omega>1\n would result in a significantly worse fit to the data. Note that, as a shortcut, aBSREL will only perform the LRT for a branch if it indeed contained sites with \n\\omega > 1\n. \nThis is the most time consuming phase of the analysis.\n aBSREL prints a running tally to the screen as tests proceed, including the rate distribution inferred for a particular branch under the null model (e.g. \n\\omega \\leq 1\n) the branch's \nuncorrected\n p-value. Branches not tested will show p-value=0.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the analysis completes, aBSREL will print out the list of all branches with p-values below 0.05 \nafter\n \napplying the \nHolm-Bonferroni multiple testing correction\n, and a CPU time report indicating how long each step of the analysis took:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of branches under episodic selection (26 were tested, of which 14 required optimizations) :\n    Node1 p = 2.143165644952205e-10\n    Node16 p = 0.0002007962489750659\n    D20_233 p = 0.0006790829268799037\n\n\n === CPU TIME REPORT === \n    MG94 model fit : 00:00:52\n    Rate class complexity analysis : 00:04:58\n    aBSREL model fit : 00:01:46\n    Individual branch selection testing : 00:12:02\n    Total time : 00:28:26\n\n\n\n\n\nOur aBSREL analysis determined that \nthree\n branches with evidence of episodic diversifying selection were identified: Node1, D20_233, and Node16. aBSREL will have generated four additional files named as \nPREFIX.extension\n where PREFIX is the file name chosed in step 10 above (here, PREFIX is \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex.aBSREL\n):\n\n\n\n\nPREFIX.json\n: a JSON file storing all the relevant analysis output.

All other aspects of analysis will remain the same, except runtime will be faster because fewer tests are performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse FUBAR to find sites which have experienced pervasive diversification.\n#\n\n\n\n\nFUBAR\n is described in \nMurrell et al.\n which is intended to supersede (owing to its remarkable speed and statistical performance), previous REL, SLAC, and and FEL methods (although note SLAC and FEL may still be used). Because of its exceptionally fast runtime, FUBAR is particularly useful for extremely large datasets.\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, we will run FUBAR on the dataset \nWestNileVirus_NS3.fas\n to identify sites which have experienced pervasive diversification over the entire tree. For reference, an analysis by \nBrault et al.\n using our older counting method \nSLAC\n found a single site (249) subject to pervasive positive selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch HyPhy from the command line by entering \nHYPHYMP\n.

Analysis phases will be performed with intermittent prompts asking for additional instructions.\n\n\n\n\n[FUBAR PHASE 1]\n: FUBAR wherein a nucleotide GTR model is fit to the data. Results from the GTR model fit are saved in the indicated file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce \n[FUBAR PHASE 1]\n is complete, enter \n20\n as the default grid size. This is the default FUBAR setting, meaning that a 20x20 grid of discrete \ndN\n and \ndS\n values will be used during selection inference. \n[FUBAR PHASE 2]\n will now proceed.\n\n\n\n\nOnce \n[FUBAR PHASE 2]\n is complete, respond to the following prompts:\n\n\n\n\nEnter \n5\n as the default number of MCMC chains to run. \n\n\nEnter \n2000000\n as the default length for each MCMC chain.\n\n\nEnter \n1000000\n as the default number of MCMC samples to discard as burnin.\n\n\nEnter \n100\n as the default number of samples to draw from each MCMC chain.\n\n\nEnter \n0.5\n as the default concentration parameter of the Dirichlet prior. \n[FUBAR PHASE 3]\n will now proceed to run the MCMC chains using these specified parameters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, FUBAR will finish and provide a report of sites it identified under pervasive selection:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[RESULTS] At posterior probability \n= 0.9 there were 1 sites under diversifying positive selection, of which  0.01 [0 - 0] are expected to be false positives.\n\nCodon   Prob[dN/dS\n1]   EBF[dN/dS]\n1    PSRF    N_eff\n249 0.9884428021898912  595.8810841395058   1.023623280459778   90.63329322769367\n\n\n\n\n\nThis output tells us that a single site, codon 249, has experienced diversifying positive selection (note that this is the same site as previously found by \nBrault et al.\n.

It is MUCH slower than FUBAR, however, so there's room for both.\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, we will run MEME on the dataset \nWestNileVirus_NS3.fas\n to identify sites which have experienced episodic positive selection. Analyzing this data with MEME will find sites where selection operated along a subset of branches, while the rest of the tree may have been strongly conserved (in \naddition\n to the type of sites found by FUBAR). MEME tests each individual site separately; it runs quite slowly on a desktop, but very quickly on a cluster. You may also run MEME on \ndatamonkey\n to speed up the process. MEME requires a lot of user input (this is a legacy issue and will be addressed in the upcoming HyPhy v3 release).\n\n\n\n\nLaunch HyPhy from the command line by entering \nHYPHYMP\n.

You will then see a prompt for the Significance level, for which you may enter a preferred p-value threshold (default is \n0.1\n).\n\n\nIf you have selected option \n6\n for a two-rate FEL, you will see an additional prompt asking about \nBranch Options\n. To test the whole tree for selection, enter \n1\n here for \nAll branches\n. If you selected option \n5\n for a one-rate FEL, this prompt will not appear.\n\n\nEnter \n1\n to analyze all branches. \n\n\n\n\nFEL will now run to completion. As it runs, FEL will print site-specific inferences to the screen, for example:\n\n\n[RETUNING BRANCH LENGTHS AND NUCLEOTIDE RATES UNDER THE CODON MODEL]\n\n\nIMPROVED Log(L) BY 125.2787507415687 POINTS\n\n\n| Codon:    1| dN/dS:       0.00| dN:  0.00| dS:  0.18| dS(\n=\ndN):  0.05| Log(L):      -5.91| LRT:  2.38| p:  0.12\n\n\n| Codon:    2| dN/dS:       0.00| dN:  0.00| dS:  2.13| dS(\n=\ndN):  0.18| Log(L):     -16.18| LRT:  8.75| p:  0.00 *N\n\n\n| Codon:    3| dN/dS:       0.00| dN:  0.00| dS:  0.37| dS(\n=\ndN):  0.06| Log(L):      -7.96| LRT:  2.89| p:  0.09 *N\n\n\n| Codon:    4| dN/dS:       0.00| dN:  0.00| dS:  1.88| dS(\n=\ndN):  0.33| Log(L):     -19.68| LRT:  9.43| p:  0.00 *N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen finished, FEL issues a final prompt for a CSV file name in which this site-specific information will be saved. For example, \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/WestNileVirus_NS3.fas.FEL.csv\n is a good option to provide here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis final FEL results file will have several columns:\n\n\n\n\nCodon\n: The codon site. \n\n\ndN/dS\n: The resulting \n\\omega\n estimate for this site.\n\n\ndN\n: The estimated \ndN\n parameter at this site. \n\n\ndS\n: The estimated \ndS\n parameter at this site. \n\n\ndS=dN\n: The rate estimate under the null model of evolution where the constraint \ndS=dN\n is enforced. Generally this is not needed. \n\n\nLRT\n: The likelihood ratio test statistic for comparing null and alternative models to test for selection.\n\n\np-value\n: The resulting p-value from the LRT used to test for selection.

This column is the same as \nFull Log(L)\n, except with a different name.\n\n\n\n\nRunning SLAC\n#\n\n\n\n\nTo run SLAC, enter \n1\n when you see the prompt \nAncestor Counting Options\n, to select the option \nSingle Ancestor Counting\n.\n\n\nHyPhy will proceed to fit the initial nucleotide and global codon models. You will then see a prompt for \nSLAC Options\n, for which you should enter \n1\n for \nFull tree\n. The other choice, \nTips vs Internals\n, is mostly useful for certain viral sequence, e.g. influenza, analyses but is usually not relevant.\n\n\nEnter \n1\n to select \nAveraged\n treatment of ambiguities.\n\n\nEnter \n1\n for the \nApproximate\n test statistic.\n\n\nProvide the Significance level of \n0.1\n.\n\n\n\n\nSLAC will now run to completion, very quickly, and print site-specific information about selection inference. At the top of this printed information is a summary about sites determined to be under positive/negative selection. The top portion of this information should look like this:\n\n\n******* FOUND NO POSITIVELY SELECTED SITES ********\n\n******* FOUND 175 NEGATIVELY SELECTED SITES ********\n\n+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n| Index        | Site Index   | dN-dS        | p-value      | \n+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n|            1 |     2.000000 |    -3.000000 |     0.037037 |\n+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n|            2 |     4.000000 |    -2.571328 |     0.073792 |\n+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, You will then see a prompt for \nOutput Options\n where more detailed result information.

It is based on the \nBS-REL model\n branch site framework, but the tree is partitioned (a priori) into non-overlapping sets of branches, and the separate distributions of \n are fitted to each set and compared for relative \nrelaxation\n (\n values contract to 1) or \nintensification\n (\n values move away from 1).\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, we will run RELAX on the dataset \nHIV.nex\n, which includes partial clonal HIV-1 env sequences from epidemiologically linked partners (source/donor and recipient). We will specifically test if natural selection in the recipient (\nR\n branches) and in the source/donor (\nD\n branches) operate at different intensities. Importantly, this analysis will \nnot\n use the tree provided in \nHIV.nex\n, but instead a different tree available in the example file \nHIV-relax.nwk\n. This file contains a newick phylogeny whose branches have been annotated as either \n{Recipient}\n or \n{Donor}\n. These labels were applied using this web-based \nphylotree widget\n.\n\n\n\n\nLaunch HyPhy from the command line by entering \nHYPHYMP\n. Provide the following options to the menu prompts:\n\n\nEnter \n10\n to select \nPositive Selection\n.\n\n\nEnter \n10\n to select \nTest whether selected branches are under relaxed or intensified selection against reference branches\n.\n\n\nEnter \n1\n to select the Universal genetic code.\n\n\nEnter the \nabsolute path\n to your dataset (in this case, a NEXUS file): \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex\n.\n\n\nEnter \nN\n to opt \nnot\n to use the tree found in the data file.\n\n\nEnter the \nabsolute path\n to the newick tree file which has been annotated for use in RELAX: \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV-relax.nwk\n.\n\n\nEnter \n3\n to select the branches labeled \nRecipient\n as your test set of branches (\"T set\").\n\n\nEnter \n2\n to select the branches labeled \nDonor\n as your reference set of branches (\"R set\").\n\n\nEnter \n2\n to execute only the \nMinimal\n analysis type. Note that entering \n1\n for \nAll\n tests will additionally run additional descriptive models described \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELAX will now begin to run and output information to the screen as it proceeds to completion:\n\n\n[RELAX] Obtaining branch lengths under the GTR model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2114.132338088236 \n[RELAX] Obtaining omega and branch length estimates under the partitioned MG94xGTR model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2076.093223041783 \n[RELAX] Fitting the RELAX null model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2031.204697143867 \n[RELAX] Fitting the RELAX alternative model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2024.075837744705. Relaxation parameter K = 0.4389230603260226 \n[RELAX] Likelihood ratio test for relaxation on Test branches, p = 0.0001594057084282063\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output provides several pieces of information:\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative model that selection was relaxed/intensified along the \"test\" branches significantly outperformed the null model with a P-value=\n1.59\\times10^{-4}\n, as assessed with the likelihood ratio test. \nWe therefore reject the null hypothesis that selection intensity has not shifted from the reference to the test branches.\n\n\nRELAX estimated the \nselection intensity parameter\n value of \nK=0.439\n (note that K=1 is RELAX's null hypothesis). Because K is \nless than 1\n, we can infer that selection \nwas relaxed/was weaker\n along the test than on the reference branches. In other words, \n\\omega\n rates \"shrank\" towards 1 on the test branches compared to the reference branches. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike in other analyses, HyPhy will generate a JSON file, in this case called \nHIV.nex.RELAX.json\n, in the same directory where the original dataset \nHIV.nex\n is located. This JSON file contains all the relevant analysis output, and can visualize, explore, and obtain plots from this JSON file using the \nHyPhy Vision web application\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating analyses\n#\n\n\nAll above examples use HyPhy interactively. This approach, however, may be exceptionally tedious if you have many datasets to analyze (or if you don't want to use HyPhy interactively). In this case, it would be better to automate analyses in HyPhy. The best way to accomplish this goal is by \npiping\n arguments (\n|\n symbol) into HyPhy. \n\n\nFor example, if you look through the BUSTED tutorial above, you will see these options provided to the interactive HyPhy session, in order:\n\n\n\n\n10\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n1\n \n\n\n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex\n  \n\n\nY\n\n\n1\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\nYou can combine all of these input options in a single HyPhy call:\n\n\necho `(echo \n10\n; echo \n4\n; echo \n1\n; echo \n/path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex\n; echo \nY\n; echo \n1\n; echo \nd\n) | HYPHYMP`\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have several datasets to analyze, a for-loop may come in handy:\n\n\n# Path to files of interest\nFILEPATH=/absolute/path/to/directory/with/all/your/files/\n\n# Run BUSTED on all files $FILEPATH/*.fas\nfor FILE in `ls $FILEPATH/*.fas`; do\n    echo \nRunning BUSTED on $FILE\n\n    echo `(echo \n10\n; echo \n4\n; echo \n1\n; echo $FILE; echo \nY\n; echo \n1\n; echo \nd\n) | HYPHYMP`\ndone",

Note that this analysis differs from the BUSTED example described above because aBSREL will scan the phylogeny\nfor all the branches where selection may have operated. As with BUSTED, we will run aBSREL in two ways:   Run aBSREL to test for selection by scanning all branches in the tree.  Run BUSTED to test for selection by testing only an  a priori  selection of branches. This approach of analysis will have increased power to detect lineage-specific selection.",

This is the simplest model that can be selected by aBSREL.  [PHASE 1] : aBSREL then sorts all the branches by length (longest first), and tries to greedily add  \\omega  categories to one branch at a time, until the addition is no longer justified by AIC c  scores.  [INFERRED MODEL COMPLEXITY] : When aBSREL has determined the optimal number of  \\omega  categories at each branch, a summary of inferred model complexity will be printed to the screen.  [PHASE 2] : Next, aBSREL optimizes all model parameters for the branch models determined in  [PHASE 1] .  Next, aBSREL will test all the branches selected in step 1.8 above (in this example,  All  branches) to see if there is a proportion of sites\nwith  \\omega > 1  along that branch. aBSREL further assesses, using branch-specific Likelihood ratio tests, whether disallowing any categories of  \\omega>1  would result in a significantly worse fit to the data. Note that, as a shortcut, aBSREL will only perform the LRT for a branch if it indeed contained sites with  \\omega > 1 .  This is the most time consuming phase of the analysis.  aBSREL prints a running tally to the screen as tests proceed, including the rate distribution inferred for a particular branch under the null model (e.g.  \\omega \\leq 1 ) the branch's  uncorrected  p-value. Branches not tested will show p-value=0.5.

For this example, we will run FUBAR on the dataset  WestNileVirus_NS3.fas  to identify sites which have experienced pervasive diversification over the entire tree. For reference, an analysis by  Brault et al.  using our older counting method  SLAC  found a single site (249) subject to pervasive positive selection.

This file contains a newick phylogeny whose branches have been annotated as either  {Recipient}  or  {Donor} . These labels were applied using this web-based  phylotree widget .   Launch HyPhy from the command line by entering  HYPHYMP . Provide the following options to the menu prompts:  Enter  10  to select  Positive Selection .  Enter  10  to select  Test whether selected branches are under relaxed or intensified selection against reference branches .  Enter  1  to select the Universal genetic code.  Enter the  absolute path  to your dataset (in this case, a NEXUS file):  /path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV.nex .  Enter  N  to opt  not  to use the tree found in the data file.  Enter the  absolute path  to the newick tree file which has been annotated for use in RELAX:  /path/to/downloaded/example/files/HIV-relax.nwk .  Enter  3  to select the branches labeled  Recipient  as your test set of branches (\"T set\").  Enter  2  to select the branches labeled  Donor  as your reference set of branches (\"R set\").  Enter  2  to execute only the  Minimal  analysis type. Note that entering  1  for  All  tests will additionally run additional descriptive models described  here .     RELAX will now begin to run and output information to the screen as it proceeds to completion:  [RELAX] Obtaining branch lengths under the GTR model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2114.132338088236 \n[RELAX] Obtaining omega and branch length estimates under the partitioned MG94xGTR model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2076.093223041783 \n[RELAX] Fitting the RELAX null model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2031.204697143867 \n[RELAX] Fitting the RELAX alternative model \n[RELAX] Log(L) = -2024.075837744705. Relaxation parameter K = 0.4389230603260226 \n[RELAX] Likelihood ratio test for relaxation on Test branches, p = 0.0001594057084282063  The output provides several pieces of information:   The alternative model that selection was relaxed/intensified along the \"test\" branches significantly outperformed the null model with a P-value= 1.59\\times10^{-4} , as assessed with the likelihood ratio test.  We therefore reject the null hypothesis that selection intensity has not shifted from the reference to the test branches.  RELAX estimated the  selection intensity parameter  value of  K=0.439  (note that K=1 is RELAX's null hypothesis). Because K is  less than 1 , we can infer that selection  was relaxed/was weaker  along the test than on the reference branches. In other words,  \\omega  rates \"shrank\" towards 1 on the test branches compared to the reference branches.      Like in other analyses, HyPhy will generate a JSON file, in this case called  HIV.nex.RELAX.json , in the same directory where the original dataset  HIV.nex  is located. This JSON file contains all the relevant analysis output, and can visualize, explore, and obtain plots from this JSON file using the  HyPhy Vision web application .",

Alternatively, you can analyze the entire tree for episodic diversification, in which case branch annotation is not needed and a \"regular\" newick tree will be fine.       Launch a terminal session and navigate to the directory where you have compiled the development version of HyPhy.  From within this directory , issue the following command to run BUSTED and respond to the prompts. Be sure to provide  absolute paths  for all file names prompted.  ./HYPHYMP LIBPATH=`pwd`/res res/TemplateBatchFiles/SelectionAnalyses/BUSTED.bf    Alternatively, you can pipe the arguments directly into the HyPhy call to BUSTED. Note that, as written, this command will instruct BUSTED to consider all branches as foreground:  (echo 1; echo  path to sequence file ; echo  path to tree file ; echo 4; echo d) | ./HYPHYMP LIBPATH=`pwd`/res res/TemplateBatchFiles/SelectionAnalyses/RELAX.bf    In the above example, the piped arguments correspond to the following:   1  - Select the Universal Code  path to sequence file  - the  absolute path /filename of the multiple sequence alignment  path to tree file  - the  absolute path /filename of the labeled newick tree  4  - Test for selection on all branches labeled with {FOREGROUND} jointly  d  - Complete branch selection       Once the BUSTED job is completed, there will be a file that is generated in the\nsame directory as the sequence file named  sequence-file .BUSTED.json . The file is standard JSON, and can be parsed with any programming language. You can also visualize, explore, and obtain plots from this JSON file using the  HyPhy Vision web application .",

            "text": "FEL  is described in  Pond and Frost . FEL estimates\nsite-wise synonymous ( \\alpha ) and non-synonymous ( \\beta ) rates, and uses a\nlikelihood ratio test to determine if  \\beta \\neq \\alpha  at each site. The estimates\naggregate information over all branches, so the signal is derived from\npervasive diversification or conservation.   Note that you can use FEL via  Datamonkey , you can or follow  this tutorial  to use FEL in the current version of HyPhy. Otherwise, follow these directions to run FEL in the development branch of HyPhy:  Please also note that FEL is an MPI-aware script. You are free to use HYPHYMPI (instead of HYPHYMP) in conjunction with mpirun on computing clusters for improved performance.
